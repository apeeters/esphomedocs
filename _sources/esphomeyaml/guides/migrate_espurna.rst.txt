Migrating from ESPurna
======================

Migrating from previous ESPurna setups is very easy. You just need to have
esphomeyaml create a binary for you and then upload that in the ESPurna web interface.

Getting Binary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First follow the guides for the :ref:`different supported devices <devices>` and create a configuration
file. Then, generate and download the binary:

- **Using the HassIO add-on/dashboard**: Just click the ``COMPILE`` button, wait for
  the compilation to end and press the ``DOWNLOAD BINARY`` button.

- **Using the command line**: run ``esphomeyaml livingroom.yaml compile`` (replacing
  ``livingroom.yaml`` with your configuration file of course) and navigate to the
  ``<NODE_NAME>/.pioenvs/<NODE_NAME>/`` folder. There you will find a ``firmware.bin`` file,
  this is the binary you will upload.

Uploading Binary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To upload the binary, navigate to the ESPurna web interface and enter the
"General " section.

In the "Upgrade" section, choose the binary you previously downloaded and press "Upgrade".
If everything succeeds, you should now have esphomelib on your node ðŸŽ‰

.. note::

    With esphomelib, you in most cases won't need to worry about the available flash size, as
    the binary only ever includes the code that you are actually using.

Happy Hacking!
