Status LED
==========

The ``status_led`` hooks into all esphomelib components and can indicate the status of
the device. Specifically, it will:

- Blink slowly (about every second) when a **warning** is active. Warnings are active when for
  example reading a sensor value fails temporarily or the WiFi/MQTT connections are disrupted.
- Blink quickly (multiple times per second) when an **error** is active. Errors indicate that
  esphomelib has found an error while setting up. In most cases, esphomelib will still try to
  recover from the error and continue with all other operations.
- Stay off otherwise.

.. code:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    status_led:
      pin: GPIO2

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **pin** (**Required**, :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>`): The
  GPIO pin to operate the status LED on.
- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.

.. note::

    If your LED is in an active-LOW mode (when it's on if the output is enabled), use the
    ``inverted`` option of the :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>`:

    .. code:: yaml

        status_led:
          pin:
            number: D0
            inverted: True
