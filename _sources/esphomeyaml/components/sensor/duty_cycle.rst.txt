Duty Cycle Sensor
=================

The duty cycle sensor allows you to measure for what percentage of time a signal
on a GPIO pin is HIGH or LOW.

For example, you can measure if a status LED of a pool controller is permanently active
(indicating that the pump is on) or blinking.

    # Example configuration entry
    sensor:
      - platform: duty_cycle
        pin: D0
        name: Duty Cycle Sensor

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **pin** (*Optional*, :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>`): The pin to observe for the duty
  cycle.
- **update_interval** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The interval to check the sensor. Defaults to ``15s``.
