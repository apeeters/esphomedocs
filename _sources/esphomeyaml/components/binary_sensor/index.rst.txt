Binary Sensor Component
=======================

With esphomelib you can use different types of binary sensors. They will
automatically appear in the Home Assistant front-end and have several
configuration options.


.. _config-binary_sensor:

Base Binary Sensor Configuration
--------------------------------

All binary sensors have a platform and an optional device class. By
default, the binary will chose the appropriate device class itself, but
you can always override it.

.. code:: yaml

    binary_sensor:
      - platform: ...
        device_class: motion

Configuration variables:

- **device_class** (*Optional*, string): The device class for the
  sensor. See https://www.home-assistant.io/components/binary_sensor/
  for a list of available options.
- **inverted** (*Optional*, boolean): Whether to invert the binary
  sensor output, i.e.Â report ON states as OFF and vice versa. Defaults
  to ``False``.
- **on_press** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to perform
  when the button is pressed. See :ref:`binary_sensor-on_press`.
- **on_release** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to perform
  when the button is released. See :ref:`binary_sensor-on_release`.
- **on_click** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to perform
  when the button is held down for a specified period of time.
  See :ref:`binary_sensor-on_click`.
- **on_click** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to perform
  when the button is pressed twice for specified periods of time.
  See :ref:`binary_sensor-on_double_click`.
- All other options from :ref:`MQTT Component <config-mqtt-component>`.

Binary Sensor Automation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The triggers for binary sensors in esphomeyaml use the lingo from computer mouses. This naming might not
perfectly fit every use case, but at least makes the naming consistent. For example, a ``press`` is triggered
in the first moment when the button on your mouse is pushed down.

You can access the current state of the binary sensor in :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>` using
``id(binary_sensor_id).value``.

.. _binary_sensor-on_press:

``on_press``
""""""""""""

This automation will be triggered when the button is first pressed down, or in other words on the leading
edge of the signal.

.. code:: yaml

    binary_sensor:
      - platform: gpio
        # ...
        on_press:
          then:
            - switch.turn_on:
                id: relay_1

Configuration variables: See :ref:`Automation <automation>`.

.. _binary_sensor-on_release:

``on_release``
""""""""""""""

This automation will be triggered when a button press ends, or in other words on the falling
edge of the signal.

.. code:: yaml

    binary_sensor:
      - platform: gpio
        # ...
        on_release:
          then:
            - switch.turn_off:
                id: relay_1

Configuration variables: See :ref:`Automation <automation>`.

.. _binary_sensor-on_click:

``on_click``
""""""""""""

This automation will be triggered when a button is pressed down for a time period of length
``min_length`` to ``max_length``. Any click longer or shorter than this will not trigger the automation.
The automation is therefore also triggered on the falling edge of the signal.

.. code:: yaml

    binary_sensor:
      - platform: gpio
        # ...
        on_click:
          min_length: 50ms
          max_length: 350ms
          then:
            - switch.turn_off:
                id: relay_1

Configuration variables:

- **min_length** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The minimum duration the click should last. Defaults to ``50ms``.
- **max_length** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The maximum duration the click should last. Defaults to ``350ms``.
- See :ref:`Automation <automation>`.

.. _binary_sensor-on_double_click:

``on_double_click``
"""""""""""""""""""

.. warning::

    This trigger is not final and could be replaced by a ``on_multi_click`` option which would
    allow triggering for any number of clicks.

This automation will be triggered when a button is pressed down twice, with the first click lasting between
``min_length`` and ``max_length``. When a second leading edge then happens within ``min_length`` and
``max_length``, the automation is triggered.

.. code:: yaml

    binary_sensor:
      - platform: gpio
        # ...
        on_double_click:
          min_length: 50ms
          max_length: 350ms
          then:
            - switch.turn_off:
                id: relay_1

Configuration variables:

- **min_length** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The minimum duration the click should last. Defaults to ``50ms``.
- **max_length** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The maximum duration the click should last. Defaults to ``350ms``.
- See :ref:`Automation <automation>`.

lambda calls
""""""""""""

From :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`, you can call several methods on all binary sensors to do some
advanced stuff (see the full :doc:`API Reference </api/binary_sensor/index>` for more info).

- ``publish_state()``: Manually cause the binary sensor to publish and store a state from anywhere
  in the program.

  .. code:: yaml

      // Within lambda, publish an OFF state.
      id(my_binary_sensor).publish_state(false);

      // Within lambda, publish an ON state.
      id(my_binary_sensor).publish_state(true);

- ``value``: Retrieve the current value of the binary sensor.

  .. code:: yaml

      // Within lambda, get the binary sensor state and conditionally do something
      if (id(my_binary_sensor).value) {
        // Binary sensor is ON, do something here
      } else {
        // Binary sensor is OFF, do something else here
      }
