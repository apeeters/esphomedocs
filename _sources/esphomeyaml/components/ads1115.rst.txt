ADS1115 Hub
===========

The ``ads1115`` domain creates a global hub so that you can later create
individual sensors using the :doc:`ADS1115 Sensor Platform </esphomeyaml/components/sensor/ads1115>`.
To use this hub, first setup the :ref:`I²C Bus <i2c>` and connect the sensor to the pins specified there.

    ads1115:
      - address: 0x48

Configuration variables:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **address** (**Required**, int): The i²c address of the sensor.
  See :ref:`I²C Addresses <ads1115_i2c_addresses>` for more information.
- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID for this ADS1115 Hub. Use this if you
  want to use multiple ADS1115 hubs at once.

I²C Addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to allow multiple sensors to be connected to the same i²c bus,
the creators of this sensor hardware have included some options to
change the i²c address.

-  If the address pin is pulled to GND, the address is ``0x48`` (Default).
-  If the address pin is pulled to VCC, the address is ``0x49``.
-  If the address pin is tied to SDA, the address is ``0x4a``.
-  If the address pin is tied to SCL, the address is ``0x4B``.
