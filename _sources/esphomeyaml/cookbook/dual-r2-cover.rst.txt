Dual relay cover motor control
==============================

The following is a possible configuration file for common covers that use a motor with 2 inputs. Only one should be powered at a time (interlocking) to either move the cover up or down. For this the `Sonoff Dual R2 <https://www.itead.cc/sonoff-dual.html>`__ can be used which has two independent relays. Additionally this configuration allows the single button on the Sonoff to control the motion by cycling between: open->stop->down->stop->...

These kind of motors automatically stop when the end of the cover movement is reached. However, to be safe, this automation stops powering the motor after 1 minute of movement. In the rare case of the end-stop switch in the motor failing this will reduce the risk for damage or fire.

Of the four main components (button sensor, 2 relays switches and the cover), only the cover will be visible to the end-user. The other three are hidden by means of not including a ``name``. This is to prevent accidentally switching on both relays simultaneously from MQTT/Home-assistant as that might be harmful for some motors.

.. note::

    Controlling the cover to quickly (sending new open/close commands within a minute of previous commands) might cause unexpected behaviour (eg: cover stopping halfway). This is because the delayed relay off feature is implemented using asynchronous automations. So every time a open/close command is sent a delayed relay off command is added and old ones are not removed.
